Since 2018, Bong Go has used the launching of the government’s one-stop shop “Malasakit Center” to bring his name into the forefront—appearing in every photo-op and claiming that it is a project realized through his advocacy. However, Malasakit Centers is an initiative created and funded by multiple government agencies, namely Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office, Philippine Amusement and Games Corporation, PhilHealth, Department of Health, at Department of Social Work and Development (Rapper, 2019)
</li>
        <li><strong>Frigate Procurement Controversy (2018):</strong> Denied involvement in the frigate deal controversy and was cleared by various parties, including former Philippine Navy officials.</li>
        <li><strong>Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs):</strong> In 2024, Go expressed opposition to POGOs, despite having previously supported their operations in 2021, raising questions about his changing stance.</li>
      </ul>
