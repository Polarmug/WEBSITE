      <h2>Controversies</h2>
      <ul>
         <!-- Restored Full Text for Controversies -->
        <li>
            <strong>Pork Barrel Scam and Plunder Charges</strong>
            <ul>
                 <li>In 2013, the Commission on Audit (COA) released a report indicating that approximately ₱1.015 billion of Senator Revilla's PDAF allocations were funneled into non-governmental organizations (NGOs) linked to businesswoman Janet Lim-Napoles, who was identified as the mastermind behind the scam. This amount was the largest among the legislators implicated in the scandal. Subsequently, in June 2014, the Office of the Ombudsman filed plunder charges against Senator Revilla, along with Senators Juan Ponce Enrile and Jinggoy Estrada, for allegedly receiving kickbacks from Napoles in exchange for allocating their PDAF to her bogus NGOs.Senator Revilla surrendered to authorities on June 20, 2014, and was detained at the Philippine National Police Custodial Center in Camp Crame. His trial commenced in June 2017.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Acquittal and Civil Liability</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>On December 7, 2018, the Sandiganbayan acquitted Senator Revilla of plunder charges, citing insufficient evidence to prove that he received kickbacks from the PDAF allocations. However, the court ordered him to return ₱124.5 million to the government, representing the amount allegedly misused. Despite the acquittal, this civil liability remains a point of contention. Notably, two Sandiganbayan justices dissented from the majority decision, arguing that the evidence indicated Senator Revilla's complicity in the misuse of funds.</li>
