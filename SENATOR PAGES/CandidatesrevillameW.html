      <h2>Controversies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ABS-CBN Contract Breach Case (2010):</strong> On August 23, 2010, Revillame filed a civil action before the Quezon City Regional Trial Court (RTC) seeking to cancel, terminate, and rescind his three-year contract with ABS-CBN (Civil Case No Q-10-67770). Under the contract, Revillame was to host the show “Wowowee” on the ABS-CBN network until September 10, 2011, or upon cancellation or earlier termination of the program.” The suit was prompted by Revillame’s withdrawal from “Wowowee” on May 5, 2010, which was followed by ABS-CBN’s refusal to release Revillame as its talent and the network’s subsequent replacement of “Wowowee” with a different program. On September 15, 2010, ABS-CBN filed its Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim, praying for liquidated damages in the amount of over PhP700 million, plus over PhP400 million for each further violation by Revillame, or for each week of violation of their contract. A month later, ABS-CBN applied for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction to restrain Revillame from performing with TV5, owned by ABC Development Corporation (ABC Corporation), on a similar show, titled “Willing Willie.” The RTC denied the TRO application but ordered Revillame to post a bond in the amount of PhP426,917,646.96 as security for any damage that may be incurred by ABS-CBN.</li>
        <li><strong>Child Abuse Allegations ("Willing Willie", 2011):</strong> The host, Willie Revillame, cajoled the child into completing the suggestive dance, despite the boy having tears streaming down his face. The audience seemed oblivious to his discomfort, laughing and cheering along with the host. It later transpired that the boy's family, like the majority of audience members, were poor, and came on the game show because of the cash prizes on offer. Human rights groups were quick to condemn the incident."This was a form of child abuse," says Magnolia Jacinto, a spokeswoman for Asia Against Child Trafficking. "The boy's human dignity wasn't respected - in fact, it was violated." Her organisation, several other campaign groups, and the government's social welfare department have filed legal cases against Revillame and TV5, the network that broadcasts Willing Willie.
